# üçÑ ASTROCADE DEV üçÑ

Let's make cute software for the Bally Astrocade!

## Introduction
I'm teaching myself how to develop for the slightly-obscure Bally Astrocade, an 8-bit home computer/game console released in the late 1970s. The Astrocade boasts impressive (for its day) specs: a 1.7MHz Z80 8-bit CPU, 4KB RAM, 256 available colors, 3 square-wave audio channels, and 4 controller ports. If you want to learn alongside me, this repo will contain the demos I create as well as any tools I create to make my workflow easier and more fun.

## What's in this repo
- The `demos` folder contains my Astrocade experiments (highly-commented source code and binaries). Compiling demos from source requires `HVGLIB.H` and the Zmac assembler. (See [Development toolchain](#development-toolchain) for more information.)
    - `01-hellowords` is baby's first Astrocade homebrew, simply displaying text that reads, "HELLO, WORLDS!"
    - `02-telephone` is an audio demo of a telephone ringing that also features background graphics.
- The `tools` folder contains tools and scripts I've created that may be of use for Astrocade software development.

## Development toolchain
To make games and software for the Bally Astrocade, grab the tools listed below. Note that these are external links; proceed with care. :)

### Tools for writing code
1. [HVGLIB.H](http://www.ballyalley.com/ml/ml_tools/HVGLIB.zip) is a Bally Astrocade library used in most tutorials and sample code. You'll typically include it at the top of your source code files by typing `INCLUDE HVGLIB.H` at the very top of your code.
2. Your favorite IDE with Z80 syntax highlighting. I use [VS Code](http://code.visualstudio.com) for Windows, Mac, or Linux, which also has a built-in terminal pane for running your compilation and testing scripts. I use the [Z80 Assembly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Imanolea.z80-asm#overview) syntax extension, which isn't specific to Astrocade development and won't recognize HVGLIB.H content. But it's better than nothing. :) The color theme is [Dracula](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula).

### Tools for graphics
The `tools` folder contains source code for Astropaint, a browser-based tool for creating Astrocade background graphics. You can also demo it online [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/hxlnt/astrocade/23cbe2a0/tools/astropaint/index.html). You'll be able to draw a screen like this one, which conforms to the graphic limitations of the Astrocade, and then export the drawing as Z80 assembly.

### Tools for assembling and testing code
1. The Zmac assembler for [Windows](http://www.ballyalley.com/ml/ml_tools/Zmac13_win32.zip) or [Linux](http://www.ballyalley.com/ml/ml_tools/zmac-linux.zip). There are different versions of this assembler floating around online, but this particular version is the one used for many tutorials and source code samples, including my own. If you choose a different Z80 assembler, do note that macros, input rules, and other assembler-specific features will differ and code examples will need to be modified accordingly.
2. Once your code is successfully assembled into a binary file, you can test it in the Astrocade emulator inside [MAME](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/releases).
3. Compiling and launching your code requires several sequential command-line processes. It's only four or five lines, but you won't want to type them again and again--and risk making errors--every time you want to test a new bit of code. So, I wrote this [compileAndLaunch.bat script](https://github.com/hxlnt/astrocade-dev/blob/master/tools/compileAndLaunch.bat), which you can find in the `tools` folder in this repo. To assemble your code and launch the resulting ROM in MAME, simply place the script alongside your source code, edit a line in the script to point to your MAME installation, save the script, then run `compileAndLaunch.bat mycode` where `mycode` is the name of your .asm file **without the file extension.**

## Additional learning resources
[Bally Alley](http://www.ballyalley.com/) is the definitive source for Bally Astrocade development. There, you'll find source code samples, tutorials, tools, manual scans, even an Astrocade-themed podcast! Much of what I make and post here will likely borrow heavily from Bally Alley's wealth of information. It's an excellent resource!
